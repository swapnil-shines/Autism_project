          Notes:
          <br />
          Hydration:
          <br />

          <br />
          Texture Preferences:
          <br />
          Consider the child&#39;s texture preferences, as some children with autism may have sensory sensitivities.
          <br />
          Supplements:
          <br />
          Consult with a healthcare professional to determine if any nutritional supplements are necessary.
          <br />
          Consistency:
